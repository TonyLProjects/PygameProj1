Frame time event scenarios:



Scenario 1:
	player initiate attack.
		3 frame initiation
		3 frame hitbox duration
		2 frame recovery


	init 							init 					init 			reset
	attack 							hitbox					rec 
	____	____	____	____	____	____	____	____	____	____
	f0		f1		f2		f3		f4		f5		f6		f7		f8		f9



	each frame:
		check input
			enque/dequeue from buffer
		check hitbox
		check hurtbox


	init attack:
		player.attack():
			still takes in input, enqueue to buffer
			also remove input actions from buffer at regular pace
			does not issue action from input 

	check hitbox:
		detectHurtbox(p1):
			happens regardless of player state (even if already stunned)
	check hitbox:
		check during hit-active frames



When to run player.tick()? 

	initialize move with an initializing frame to be ticked on the same frame of initialization
		in this case, we would tick after initialization of frame



When to init action and when to update
	case 1: init action then tick
	3 frame att, 3 frame hitbox, 2 frame recovery:

	problem:
		first frame will not show
	solution:
		add an initialization frame to every move
			+1 frame?
			

Need an attack status class since too many states with any move
