this is a list of problems/bugs

forward/backward jump detection works consistently only if directional key is held down before jump is pressed
	solution unclear

Crouch handling
	crouch action currently incorrectly handled
	crouch input handling is not consistent with input handling of other inputs
		reset crouch is activated upon release of crouch key, but not sure how to detect the release input
		current inplementation resets crouch between every ticks, if crouch is still held down, then crouch is re-initialized for the next tick
			end result is same as checking for key up, but implementation not as elegant
